  <h1>Appeal to Probability</h1>






  <p>An appeal to probability (or appeal to possibility) is the logical fallacy of taking something for granted because
    it would probably be the case (or might possibly be the case).</p>

    <li><b>Example 1 Premises:</b></li>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>I didn't bring my umbrella</li>

      <li>(unstated) Anything which is possible is certain</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  It is possible to win the lottery
